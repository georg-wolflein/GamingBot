# [GamingBot](http://georgw777.github.io/GamingBot/)


GamingBot is a simple application that enables you to let your computer do the boring part of gaming for you. 
If you're playing a game where you can repeat quests or missions to earn gems or credits, just simply let the computer repeat it overnight and you'll be rich the next morning!

This is the first project that I am hosting on GitHub, although I programmed this application last year (2012). Please do comment and give me suggestions. 
I am going to add a feature so that you can record the routines by actually doing them, instead of writing the code. 


## Screenshot

This shows the application's main window. 


## Installing
Please note that this application was programmed in Visual Basic and therefore only works on the Windows operating system. 


### Setup
If you want to do a full setup (install it on your computer) open [INSTALL](INSTALL) and execute [setup.exe](INSTALL/setup.exe). This will correctly install it on your machine. Alternatly, you can download "INSTALL.zip" from the latest [release](../../releases). 


### Just to try
If you do not want a full installation and just want to test it, navigate to [INSTALL/Application Files](INSTALL/Application Files) and open the latest version of GamingBot. Then, execute GamingBot.exe. Have fun! As mentioned above, you can download "INSTALL.zip" from the latest [release](../../releases). 


### Problems
If you are encountering problems during the installation, it's probably because you did not download the whole [INSTALL](INSTALL) folder. The [setup.exe](INSTALL/setup.exe) file has to be able to access the [Application Files](INSTALL/Application Files) folder. 

Another problem might be that you cannot start the application. If this is the case, make sure that the DLL [Main.dll](GamingBot/Main.dll) is located in the same directory as GamingBot.exe.

## Programming routines
In order to create a routine that the computer should execute, you have to do a little coding, which is actually quite simple. For starters, press "Generate Sample Data" and look at the files. The commands are fairly self-explanatory. 
If you need more help, view the [GamingBot programming language documentation](../../wiki/GamingBot-Programming-Language).
